DESCRIPTION
  Kawa (pronounced kava) is a Scheme interpreter written completely in Java.
  Scheme procedures are compiled into Java bytecodes for efficiency.

  The release includes a number of useful classes, including
  a package that makes it easy to create .class files, and
  powerful Number classes.

  The full sources and documentation is available by anonymous ftp
  from ftp.cygnus.com, in pub/bothner/kawa-1.2.tar.gz.

  The pre-compiled .class files (only) are in the same directory
  in kawa-1.2-compiled.tar.gz.

VERSION
  Kawa 1.2.

CHANGES

  Added primitives to make it easy to call arbitrary Java methods
  from Scheme.

  Exact rational arithetic is now fully implemented.
  All integer functions now believed to correctly handle bignums.
  Logical operations on exact integers have been implemented.
  These include all the logical functions from Guile.

  Complex numbers are implemented (except {,a}{sin,cos,tan}).
  Quantities (with units) are implemented (as in DSSSL).

  Eval is available, as specified for R5RS.
  Also implemented are scheme-report-environment, null-environment, and
  interaction-environment.

  Internal define is implemented.

  Rough support for multiple threads is implemented.

  Moved kawa class to kawa/repl.  Merged in kawac (compiler)
  functionality.  A 'kawa' shell-script is now created.
  This is now the preferred interface to both the interactive
  evaluator and the compiler (on Unix-like systems).

  Now builds "without a snag" using Cafe 1.51 under Win95.
  (Symantec JIT (ver 2.00b19) requires disabling JIT - JAVA_COMPCMD=disable.)
  Compiles under JDK 1.1 beta (with some warnings).

  A testsuite (and testing framework) was added.

  Documentation moved to doc directory.
  There is now an internals overview, in doc/kawa-tour.ps.

PRICE
  Free for commercial and non-commercial use.
