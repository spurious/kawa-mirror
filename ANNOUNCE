DESCRIPTION
  Kawa (pronounced kava) is a Scheme evaluator written completely in Java.
  Scheme procedures are compiled into Java bytecodes for efficiency.

  This is a fairly complete implementation of Scheme, with many useful
  extensions, but general tail-call-elimination and continuations
  are not supported yet.

  The release includes a number of useful classes, including
  a package that makes it easy to create .class files, and
  powerful Number classes.

  The full sources and documentation is available by anonymous ftp
  from ftp.cygnus.com, in pub/bothner/kawa-current.tar.gz.

  The pre-compiled .class files (only) are in the same directory
  in kawa-current-compiled.tar.gz.

VERSION
  Kawa 1.6.1.

CHANGES

  There have been many changes since the last public release.
  Major ones include access to Java fields and arrays;  exception
  handling (low-level try-catch as well as Guile's catch/throw);
  internationalized ports with a programmable promt and transcript;
  ability to compile a stand-alone Scheme application;  various
  optimizations;  numerous new procedures;  and a better home page,
  including javadoc internals documentation and a mail archive.
  See http://www.cygnus.com/~bothner/kawa/News.txt.

  There is now a .deb package file for easy installation on Debian
  GNU/Linux systems.


PRICE
  Free for commercial and non-commercial use.
