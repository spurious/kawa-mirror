ANNOUNCE:  Kawa Scheme interpreter and compiler, version 0.3
=============================================================================

A new version of the Kawa interpreter is availiable.

Kawa (pronounced kava) is a Scheme interpreter written completely in Java.
Scheme procedures are now compiled into Java bytecodes for efficiency.

The full sources and documentation is available by anonymous ftp
from ftp.cygnus.com, in pub/bothner/kawa-0.3.tar.gz.

The pre-compiled .class files (only) are in the same directory
in kawa-0.3-compiled.tar.gz.

The release will shortly also be availble from:
	http://www.winternet.com/~sgml/kawa/index.html

A slightly out-of-date design document discussing gow to compile
Scheme into Java is in http://www.cygnus.com/~bothner/scm2java.html.

Changes since 0.2:
==================
The biggest single change is that Scheme procedures are now compiled
to Java bytecodes.  This is mainly for efficiency, but it also allows
us to do tail-recursion-elimination in some cases.

The "codegen" library is included.  This is a toolkit that handles
most of the details needed to generate Java bytecode (.class) files.

The internal structure of Kawa has been extensively re-written,
especially how syntax transforms, eval, and apply are done,
largely due to the needs for compilation.

Almost all the R4RS procedures are now implemented, except that
there are stiil large gaps in Section 6.5 "Numbers".

A new author:  This release is made by Per Bothner of Cygnus Support,
with help from R. Alexander Milowsk, the original author of Kawa.
