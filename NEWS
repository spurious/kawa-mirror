Changes in 1.2 since 1.0
========================

Moved kawa class to kawa/repl.  Merged in kawac (compiler)
functionality.  A 'kawa' shell-script is now created.
This is now the preferred interface to both the interactive
evaluator and the compiler (on Unix-like systems).

Now builds "without a snag" using Cafe 1.51 under Win95.
(Symantec JIT (ver 2.00b19) requires disabling JIT - JAVA_COMPCMD=disable.)
Compiles under JDK 1.1 beta (with some warnings).

Documentation moved to doc directory.
There is now an internals overview, in doc/kawa-tour.ps.

Added primitives to make it easy to call arbitrary Java methods
from Scheme.

Internal define is implemented.

Rough support for multiple threads is implemented.

Quantities (with units) are implemented (as in DSSSL).
Complex numbers are implemented (except {,a}{sin,cos,tan}).

Logical operations on exact integers have been implemented.
These include all the logical functions from Guile.

Exact rational arithetic is now fully implemented.
All integer functions now believed to correctly handle bignums.

A testsuite (and testing framework) was added.

Eval is available, as specified for R5RS.
Also implemented are scheme-report-environment, null-environment, and
interaction-environment.

Lexical bindings are now always handled by the compiler.
The evaluator no longer understand lexical scopes (such as a "let");
a top-level "let" (just like a "lambda") now forces compilation.

Changes since 0.4:
==================

The numeric classes have been re-written.  There is partial support
for bignums (infinite-precision integers), but divide (for example)
has not been implemented yet.  The representation of bignums uses
2's complement, where the "big digits" are laid out so as to be
compatible with the mpn functions of the GNU Multi-Precision library
(gmp).  (The intent is that a future version of Kawa will support
an option to use gmp native functions for speed.)

The kawa application takes a number of useful command-line switches.

Basically all of R4RS has been implemented.  All the essential
forms and functions are implemented.  Almost all of the optional
forms are implemented.  The exceptions are transcript-on,
transcript-off, and the functions for complex numbers,
and fractions (exact non-integer rationals).

Loading a source file with load now wraps the entire file in
a lambda (named "atFileLevel").  This is for better error
reporting, and consistency with compile-file.

Changes since 0.3:
==================
The hygienic macros described in the appendix to R4RS are now
impemented (but only the define-syntax form).  They are
used to implement the standard "do" form.

The R5RS multiple value functions values and call-with-values are implemented.

Macros (and primitive syntax) can now be autoloaded as well as procedures.

New kawac application compiles to one or more .class files.

Compile time errors include line numbers.
Uncaught exceptions cause a stack trace that includes .scm line numbers.
This makes it more practical to debug Kawa with a Java debugger.

Quasiquotation is implemented.

Various minor bug fixes and optimizations.

Changes since 0.2:
==================
The biggest single change is that Scheme procedures are now compiled
to Java bytecodes.  This is mainly for efficiency, but it also allows
us to do tail-recursion-elimination in some cases.

The "codegen" library is included.  This is a toolkit that handles
most of the details needed to generate Java bytecode (.class) files.

The internal structure of Kawa has been extensively re-written,
especially how syntax transforms, eval, and apply are done,
largely due to the needs for compilation.

Almost all the R4RS procedures are now implemented, except that
there are stiil large gaps in Section 6.5 "Numbers".
