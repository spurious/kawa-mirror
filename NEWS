Changes since 0.3:
==================
The hygienic macros described in the appendix to R4RS are now
impemented (but only the define-syntax for).  They are
used to implement the standard "do" form.

The R5RS multiple value functions values and call-with-values are implemented.

Macros (and primitive syntax) can now be autoloaded as well as procedures.

New kawac application compiles to one or more .class files.

Compile time errors include line numbers.
Uncaught exceptions so a stack trace that includes line numbers.
This makes it more practical to debug Kawa with a Java debugger.

Quasiquotation is implemented.

Various minor bug fixes and optimizations.

Changes since 0.2:
==================
The biggest single change is that Scheme procedures are now compiled
to Java bytecodes.  This is mainly for efficiency, but it also allows
us to do tail-recursion-elimination in some cases.

The "codegen" library is included.  This is a toolkit that handles
most of the details needed to generate Java bytecode (.class) files.

The internal structure of Kawa has been extensively re-written,
especially how syntax transforms, eval, and apply are done,
largely due to the needs for compilation.

Almost all the R4RS procedures are now implemented, except that
there are stiil large gaps in Section 6.5 "Numbers".
