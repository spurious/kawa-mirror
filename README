	README for kawa-0.3 release

This documents how to install and use Kawa, a Scheme system
implemented in Java, and which compiles into Java bytecodes.

The file NEWS summarizes changes since previous releases.


Running Kawa
============

The interface to Kawa is typical of Scheme interpreters.
You start it by typing:

	java kawa

(Remember, the Java interpreter must be on your PATH,
and the kawa.class file must be in your CLASSPATH.)

You will then get the "kawa>" prompt, which means you are
in the Java read-eval-print-loop.  If you type a Scheme
expression, Kawa will evaluate it.  Kawa will then print the
result (if there is a non-"void" result).

To exit Kawa, type the end-of-file character (normally ctrl/D),
or call the exit procedure (with 0 or 1 integer argument).
