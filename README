KAWA, THE JAVA-BASED SCHEME SYSTEM
----------------------------------

Kawa is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.
It is implemented in Java, and compiles Scheme into Java byte-codes.

The file kawa.txt (which was automatically generated from kawa.texi)
explains how to build, install, and use Kawa.
The file kawa.html contains the same information in HTML format.

The file NEWS summarizes recent changes.

The file Compliance.html summarizes divergence from the R4RS.

A slightly out-of-date design document discussing how to compile
Scheme into Java is in http://www.cygnus.com/~bothner/scm2java.html.
