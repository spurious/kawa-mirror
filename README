KAWA, THE JAVA-BASED SCHEME SYSTEM
----------------------------------

Kawa is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.
It is implemented in Java, and compiles Scheme into Java byte-codes.

Documentation is in the doc directory.
The file doc/kawa.txt (which was automatically generated from doc/kawa.texi)
explains how to build, install, and use Kawa.
The file doc/kawa.html contains the same information in HTML format.
An overview of how Kawa works is in doc/kawa-tour.ps.

The file NEWS summarizes recent changes.

Kawa's copyright is in doc/license.terms.
(The Kawa distribution includes the packages gnu.bytecode and gnu.math,
which have different terms - but which impose no restrictions as long as
you do not modify those two packages).

The file doc/Compliance.html summarizes divergence from the R4RS.
