KAWA, THE JAVA-BASED SCHEME SYSTEM
----------------------------------

Kawa is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.
It is implemented in Java, and compiles Scheme into Java byte-codes.

Documentation is in the doc directory.
The file doc/kawa.txt (which was automatically generated from doc/kawa.texi)
explains how to build, install, and use Kawa.
The file doc/kawa.html contains the same information in HTML format.

The file NEWS summarizes recent changes.

Kawa's copyright is in doc/license.terms.

The file Compliance.html summarizes divergence from the R4RS.

A slightly out-of-date design document discussing how to compile
Scheme into Java is in http://www.cygnus.com/~bothner/scm2java.html.
