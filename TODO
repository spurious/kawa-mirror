Update to match kawa-paper:
  Vector -> FVector
  Quote -> quote  (also Lambda -> lambda)

Should SyntaxRule inherit from Pattern?

Complete R4RS procedures.

Add nicer way to access native java methods.

We depend on some hacks to automake:
- info files make in builddir, not $(srcdir)
- DATA is added to DIST_DEPFILES
- distdir also searches current dir
Try to get automake maintainers to accept these.

Implement Scheme record types as Java classes, once JDK 1.1 reflection
stuff is released.

Implement Environment properly.  Support threads, fluidvars, and modules.

Move readSchemeObject readSchemeNumber etc from InPort
to new class(es) Parser:
	class Parser;
	class SchemeReader extends Parser;  // Provides read
	class SchemeParser extends SchemeReader;  // Provides read+rewrite
Move Interpreter.syntaxError to Parser.
Treat ReadError as SyntaxError.
Support warning, error, fatal.
Parser accumulates list of syntax errors.
When done, if errors or warnings, throw SyntaxErrors.
Printing SyntaxError prints error log.

Replace use of ZipArchive by jar files (once JDK 1.1 is out).

Perhaps add #|...|# comments.  (Supposedly SCM and others have them.)
