Complete R4RS procedures.

Complete bignum support.

Add fraction and complex support.

Add access to native java methods.

We depend on 2 hacks to automake:
- info files make in builddir, not $(srcdir)
- DATA is added to DIST_DEPFILES
Try to get automake maintainers to accept these.

Implement Scheme record types as Java classes, once JDK 1.1 reflection
stuff is released.

Implement Environment properly.  Support threads, fluidvars, and modules.

Move readSchemeObject readSchemeNumber etc from InPort
to new class(es) Parser:
	class Parser;
	class SchemeReader extends Parser;  // Provides read
	class SchemeParser extends SchemeReader;  // Provides read+rewrite
Move Interpreter.syntaxError to Parser.
Treat ReadError as SyntaxError.
Support warning, error, fatal.
Parser accumulates list of syntax errors.
When done, if errors or warnings, throw SyntaxErrors.
Printing SyntaxError prints error log.

Replace use of ZipArchive by jar files (once JDK 1.1 is out).

Perhaps add #|...|# comments.  (Supposedly SCM and others have them.)
