The file kawa-manual.epub contains the Kawa documentation packaged
as an e-book in EPUB format.  It should be readable by most standalone
e-book readers.  There are also plugins available for various browsers.

The script browse-kawa-manual (in ../bin) works as a very simple
but functional reader for the Kawa documentation.  It uses the JavaFX
WebView component.

The web page script +default+ in this directory is another way to
browse the documentation using Kawa's builtin web server and your
favorite browser (no plugin needed).  Instructions are in the script.

When you read the epub version using browse-kawa-manual or the +default+
web script you don't get the nice navigation side-bar of the web site.
(Most ebook readers automatically provide that.)  This will hopefully
be improved.  You can generate the web-page-style html files from
the source with 'cd doc && make web/index.html', but this requires
various tools including xsltproc and the docbook style sheets.
