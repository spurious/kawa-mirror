The file kawa-manual.epub contains the Kawa documentation packaged
as an e-book in EPUB format.  It should be readable by most standalone
e-book readers.  There are also plugins available for various browsers.

You can also read the manual with the kawa --browse-manual option:

  $ kawa --browse-manual

Here kawa is one of kawa or kawa.bat in the ../bin directory.

This command starts a mini-web-server, and then creates a window or tab
to read it using your default browser.

You can specify some other browser - for example:

  $ kawa --browse-manual="firefox %U"

This runs the command quoted, after Kawa replaces %U with a URL
referencing Kawa's mini-web-server.

An epub is essentially a zip archive, which you can unzip:

    cd $KAWA_HOME/doc
    unzip kawa-manual.epub

Then you can use a plain browser with the URL
file:$KAWA_HOME/doc/OEBPS/index.xhtml.

You can generate the web-page-style html files from the source
with 'cd doc && make web/index.html', but this requires
various tools including xsltproc and the docbook style sheets.
