This is the master list of Java packages under the "gnu" top-level package.

If you want your package added, contact gnu-java@prep.ai.mit.edu.
Any packages under "gnu" must be free software.  For the precise
definition of this, see http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/philosophy/free-sw.html.
There are various ways of making a program free; we recommend
copyleft, and specifically the GNU General Public License.
See http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/philosophy/categories.html for
an explanation of these categories.
If you would like our advice in choosing a way of making a program
free that meets your goals, please contact gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.
