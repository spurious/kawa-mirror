This is the master list of Java packages under the "gnu" top-level package.
If you want your package added, contact Per Bothner <bothner@cygnus.com>.
Any packages under "gnu" must be freely restributable, though they do not
have to use the GNU General Public License.  However, we encourage
people to use the GPL for Java applications;  for re-usable Java
libraries, a modified GPL (as used by gnu.bytecode and gnu.math)
may be apporpriate.
