    <h1>JEmacs and the gnu.emacs Package</h1>
<p>
The <code>gnu.expr</code> provides various building blocks
for building an Emacs-like text editor.  It also provides a
number of Scheme procedures that have the same name and similar
functionality as the Emacs Lisp functions.
<p>
It uses the Swing tool-kit.

<h2>Plan</h2>

The plan is to use
this together with the (unfinished) <code>gnu.elisp</code>
package to provide a fully-functional re-implementation of
Emacs Lisp which compiles to Java bytecodes.
I'm hoping volunteers will help me make "JEmacs" into something
useful.  I have fairly clear ideas about much of what need to be
done.  Contact me if you are interested.

<h2>Status</h2>
Very unfinished proof of concerpt.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Load <code>emacs.scm</code> into a running Kawa.
Then evaluate:
<pre>
(emacs)
</pre>
That brings up a Emacs window.
<p>
You can do <code>(split-window)</code> to create new (sub-)windows
in an existing frame; type <code>(make-frame)</code> to create
a new frame (to-level window), or do <code>(get-buffer-create NAME)</code>
to create a new buffer.
Note also how <code>ctrl/B</code> and <code>ctrl/F</code> have been
bound to the correct functions.

<h2>License</h2>
Same as the package <code>gnu.expr</code>:  Modified Gnu Public License.
See the file <a href="http:../expr/COPYING">../expr/COPYING</a>.
For now, the copyright holder is Per Bothner;  in the future it may
make more sense to make the FSF the copyright owner, since the plan
is to use a lot of the existing ELisp packages once ELisp support
is complete.
