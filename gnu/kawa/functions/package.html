<p>Various core run-time functions and operators.</p>
<p>These are functions mostly used at run-time.
They are written in Java (rather than say Scheme) because
they're tricky the write in Scheme or because they implement
{@link gnu.expr.CanInline CanInline} or {@link gnu.expr.Inlineable Inlineable}.
