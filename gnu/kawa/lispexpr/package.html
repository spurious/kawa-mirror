<p>Support classes for compiling and running Lisp languages.</p>
<p>
A number of the classes implement a Common Lisp-style <q>lisp reader</q>
based on a programmable <dfn>read table</dfn>.
This is a fairly flexible table-driven lexer, with initially
support for Scheme and Common Lisp syntax.
</p>
<p>
The {@link gnu.kawa.lispexpr.LispLanguage LispLanguage} class collects
language-specific methods for the Lisp family of languages.</p>
<p>
A few other helper classes (mostly for compile-time) are also here.</p>
