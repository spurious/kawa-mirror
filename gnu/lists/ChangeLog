	* TreeList.java:  Make it extend AbstractSequence.
	Made various fields public for convenience that probably shouldn't be.
	(clear, size, makePosition, get, hasNext):  New method.
	(ensureSpace):  Set data to new array.  Oops.
	(beginGroup, beginAttribute):  New versions that just take an index.

	* Makefile.am:  The automake Java support does not handle "built"
	Java sources, so roll our own.

	New package.
	Many of the classes are based on ones that used to be in gnu.kawa.util.
