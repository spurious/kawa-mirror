/**
 * A Sequence is an ordered list of elements.
 * It is similar to and compatible with the Java2 java,util.List interface,
 * but does not require it.
 *
 * All standard classes that implement Sequence also extend AbstractSequence.
 * Using AbstractSequence provides default implementations for many methods,
 * and also makes things a bit more efficient.  However, client code should
 * use Sequence rather than AbstractSequence.
