LList.add(PositionContainer posSet, int posNumber, Object value)

Does SeqIterator.remove work for SimpleVector, GapVector, StableVector?

TreeList should extend AbstractSequence and implement Sequence.

Should U64Vector (etc) extend S64Vector (etc)?  Would share some code,
but I don't think a U64Vector "is-a" S64Vector.

PositionSet class (subsumes DOM NodeSet).
