    <h1>The gnu.lists package</h1>

<p>Contains utilty classes and interfaces for sequences (lists), arrays, and trees.</p>
<p>Features:
<ul>
<li>
The classes and interfaces are compatible with the Java2 Collections
framework, but do not rquire them.  A configuration option allows you
to specify whether Sequence extends java.util.List or not.</li>
<li>
Positions in a Sequence and iterators are the same kind of object,
and are represented using magic cookies.  In most collections frameworks,
when you define a new class that implements a sequence, you would
typically define a new iterator class as well.  You never do that
with <code>gnu.lists</code>; instead you implement suitable methods
in the sequence class itself.  This approach may seem strange, but it has
important performance advantages, especially in applications
where you want to go up and down nested sequences (i.e. in trees, such
as XML elements), or remember sets of positions (such as XML node-sets).</li>
<li>
The classes are designed for efficiency, especially concentrating on
minimizing object allocation.</li>
<li>
The framework supports general muli-dimensional arrays.</li>
<li>
The package is self-contained; it does not depend on classes or
features not in JDK 1.1.</li>
<li>
Various useful sequence implementations, including Lisp-style linked
lists; arrays with various element types; adjustable arrays that use a
"buffer-gap" to make insertions and deletions more efficient; and
adjustable arrays that automatically update positions on insertions
and deletions.</li>
<li> The <code>TreeList</code> class can compactly represent
a nested hetrogenous tree.  One intended usage is as a very efficient
representation for XML data.</li>
<li>
The <code>Consumer</code> interface is an abstraction of "data sinks" -
objects that can receive data and do something with them.  It is
similar to SAX's DocumentHandler but at a more abstract (and sometimes
more efficient) level.
</ul>
