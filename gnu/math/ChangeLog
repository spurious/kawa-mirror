	* DFloNum.java:  Make arithmetic generic:  We now have
	other kinds of RealNum besides DFloNum and IntNum.
	* IntNum (isOne, intLength):  New methods.
	(set):  Changed to not copy.
	(divide):  Finish the implementation to support long division.
	(quotient, remainder, modulo):  Canonicalize result.
	(add, sub, mul):  Make more generic (don't just support DFloNum).
	(setAbsolute):  Removed.
	* MPN.java (add_n):  Minor optimizaton - can avoid masking.
	(mul_1, mul):  Must use unsigned shift (>>>).
	(divide):  New method, does long division.
	(count_leading_zeros):  New method.
	(cmp):  New method overloading handles differently-sized arguments.
	(intLength):  New methods.
	* Numeric.java (add_reversed, sub_reversed, mul_reversed,
	div_reversed):  New methods.
	* RatNum.java:  Implement arithmetic on rationals.
	* RealNum.java (compare_reversed):  New method.
	* IntFraction.java:  New class, for exact rationals.
	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in (OBJ):  Add IntFraction.java.

	* IntNum.java (set):  Fix ival clash problem.
	(valueOf):  Check for high-order bit set.

	* MPN.java (sub_n, udiv_qrnnd, divmod_1, rshift, lshift,
	findLowestBit, gcd):  New functions.
	* IntNum.java (realoc):  Don't reallocate if larger size is close.
	(set):  Fix wrong comparison.
	(divide for longs):  New function.
	(divide general):  Use divide for long, or divmod_1.
	(gcd):  Implement for bignums.
	(setShiftLeft, setShiftRight, setShift, shift):  New functions.
	(toString):  We can print bignums in any radix now.
	(getAbsolute, negate):  New utility methods.

	* DFloNum.java (makeLiteral, emit):  Implement Compilable.
	* Numeric.java (FLOOR, CEILING, TRUNCATE, ROUND):  New constants.
	* RealNum.java (max, min):  New methods.
	* IntNum.java (isOdd):  Check low-order word, not high-order word!
	(setPlus, set):  New overload variants.
	(setNeg):  Renamed to setNegative.
	(divide, quotient, remiander, modulo, lcm):  New methods.
	* Makefile.{am,in}: (javadir):  Use $(subdir)
	{DEP_,}DISTFILES):  Do not include DATA (i.e. *.class).
	Replace generated EXTRA_DIST with ditto SOURCES.

	* Numeric.class, RealNum.class, DFloNum.class, RatNum.class,
	MPN.class, IntNum.class:  New class for re-vamped numerics.
